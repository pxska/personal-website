                <p>Honestly, I have just been taking really good care of our customers. I put emphasis on the welfare of
                    the
                    café and also make sure to offer the best service. <strong>Working in a team, is what stands out
                        from
                        this experience the most.</strong></p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">March 2019 - June 2019</h5>
                <p>As a marketing intern, I helped manage and support the social media channels. I wrote some blog posts
                    of different events the business attended and also managed the Facebook Ads. <strong>I learned a lot
                        about UX design and e-commerce.</strong></p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">March 2018 - June 2019</h5>
                <p>I was actually in AIESEC for a longer period of time (about 1,5 years), but in my last position I led
                    a marketing team consisting of a team leader and 4 team members. Dealth with all of the outgoing
                    communication and visual branding. <strong>Teamwork is something that came in handy, also a
                        <em>ton</em> of time management.</strong></p>
